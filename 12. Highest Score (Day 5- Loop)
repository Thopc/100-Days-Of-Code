Highest Score
Instructions
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x

Example Input
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Example Output
The highest score in the class is: 91
The highest score in the class is: 91
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

Hint
Think about the logic before writing code. How can you compare numbers against each other to see which one is larger?
